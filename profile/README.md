# Validated Patterns

Validated Patterns are an opinionated GitOps environment for OpenShift that lowers the bar for those creating repeatable and declarative deployments. Itâ€™s value is most apparent when delivering demos and solutions that combine multiple projects and technologies.  Our skeleton allows creators to focus on what needs to be delivered while we take care of how to do so using best practices.

A common gitops seed, applied to a blank OpenShift cluster and pointing to the solution in Git, allows the cluster to completely configure itself - including elements traditionally handled with scripting and extending beyond the cluster.
